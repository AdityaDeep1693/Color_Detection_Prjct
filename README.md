# Color_Detection_Prjct
As we all know that colors are made up of three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue. Their intensities can be measured between 0 to 255 and by combining them we get 6 million different color values.   This idea of this project is to get the name of the color from the color values. To implement this we use a dataset that has color values and labeled color names, then we calculate the shortest distance between each color and display the color name that has the shortest distance
